  <h3 id="tribute-headline">The career of the 3 time World Champion F1 driver</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1960</strong> - Born near Sao Paulo in the Hospital of Santana.</li>
    <li><strong>1973</strong> - His first gokart was built by his father from a lawnmower and in this year he entered his first karting competion. He started his first race on pole position, facing rivals who were some years older than him; despite this, he managed to lead most of the race before retiring after colliding with a rival. His father supported his son and Lucio Pascal Gascon soon managed the developing talent.</li>
    <li><strong>1977</strong> - He went on to win the South American Kart Championship, and he contested the Karting World Championship each year until 1982.</li>
    <li><strong>1981</strong> - Senna moved to England to begin single-seater racing, winning the RAC and Townsend-Thoreson Formula Ford 1600 Championships that year with the Van Diemen team. At the end of that season, under pressure from his parents to take up a role in the family business, Senna announced his retirement from Formula Ford and returned to Brazil. Before leaving England, however, Senna was offered a drive with a Formula Ford 2000 team for £10,000. Back in Brazil, he decided to take this offer and returned to live in England.</li>
    <li><strong>1982</strong> - He went on to win the 1982 British and European Formula Ford 2000 championships. For that season, Senna arrived with sponsorship from Banerj and Pool.</li>
    <li><strong>1983: British F3 champion</strong> - Having made his name in karting, Formula Ford 1600 and FF2000, Senna guarantees himself an F1 future, winning the prestigious British F3 championship. That fall, he tests for Williams and then McLaren, but neither team has a vacancy, so he signs a three-year deal with the middle-of-the-field Toleman team.</li>
    <li><strong>1984: Toleman-Hart (9th in championship, 0 wins)</strong> - An early switch from Pirelli to Michelin rubber improves Toleman's fortunes, though the team is forced to use obsolete compounds at top-running Pirelli partner McLaren's behest. Rain in Monaco provides a level playing field, and Senna takes a sensational second. He breaks his Toleman contract, signing with Lotus for 1985 and beyond. To punish him, the team suspends him for one race, but it's too late to prevent him from leaving.</li>
    <li><strong>1985: Lotus-Renault (4th, 2 wins)</strong> - The Renault-powered Lotus allows Senna to move up the grid, and he scores his first win on his second outing with the team in Portugal's torrential conditions. He wins again at Spa in Belgium. Seven poles attest to his brilliant speed over one lap, but the car is fragile.</li>
    <li><strong>1986: Lotus-Renault (4th, 2 wins)</strong> - Senna dominates qualifying to an even greater degree as he takes eight poles. However, he wins only twice (Spain and Detroit) as rivals Williams and McLaren have the edge in races.</li>
    <li><strong>1987: Lotus-Honda (3rd, 2 wins)</strong> - Lotus switches to Honda power, and Senna quickly forms a bond with the Japanese company and its engineers. The team loses momentum with a complex active suspension, and Williams has the advantage on pace. However, Senna wins street races in Monaco and Detroit and finishes a thus far-career-best third in the championship. In September, word comes both he and Honda will join McLaren for 1988.</li>
    <li><strong>1988: McLaren-Honda (1st, 8 wins)</strong> - In the turbo formula's last year and with other teams already switching to normally aspirated power, Honda's turbocharged V6 and McLaren's MP4/4 chassis make a mockery of the field as Senna and Prost combine to win 15 of the years 16 Grands Prix. Senna wins Imola, his second time out with McLaren, but then crashes while absolutely dominating in Monaco, a well-documented incident leading to some serious soul-searching.<br>
Meanwhile, he and longtime McLaren incumbent Prost dominate the season, winning every race except the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, where Senna clashes with backmarker Jean-Louis Schlesser. Senna is usually faster than Prost and earns an astonishing 13 poles; his performance in qualifying at Monaco, where he outpaces Prost by a staggering 1.4 seconds in the same car, is now a beyond-legendary performance. Eight race wins guarantee him his first title.</li>
    <li><strong>1989: McLaren-Honda (2nd, 6 wins)</strong> - Honda's new V10 allows Prost and Senna to set the pace once more. The pair comes into conflict at Imola after Senna reneges on an agreement not to race each other into turn one, and thereafter the gloves are off. Senna is again quicker over one lap and logs another 13 poles, but four midseason retirements give Prost the edge in the title battle. Matters come to a head in the Suzuka finale, where the pair collides as Senna tries to pass. Prost, believing his undamaged car is in fact damaged, climbs out on the spot. Senna goes on to win but is disqualified post-race for rejoining the track incorrectly, and the title goes to Prost. A distraught Senna finds himself in conflict with then-FIA chief Jean-Marie Balestre, and he questions his future in the sport.</li>
    <li><strong>1990: McLaren-Honda (1st, 6 wins)</strong> - Prost moves to Ferrari, and the rivalry continues as the pair fights for the championship. Senna wins six races and clinches his second title at Suzuka after the rivals collide at turn one when Senna spears his McLaren into the red car. He later makes it clear he had no intention of yielding, regarding the incident as payback for the previous year.</li>
    <li><strong>1991: McLaren-Honda (1st, 7 wins)</strong> - Honda maintains its winning momentum despite some issues with its new V12. Senna overcomes any shortcomings to win the first four races; the streak includes an emotional first-ever win on home ground in Brazil, achieved despite severe muscle cramping and gearbox problems. The ultra-high-tech Williams car becomes increasingly competitive as the year goes on, but Senna's strong start gives him a cushion and he secures his third title.</li>
    <li><strong>1992: McLaren-Honda (4th, 3 wins)</strong> - Nigel Mansell and the now-fully sorted active-suspension Williams are unbeatable, but a tenacious Senna logs three wins. Honda is exiting F1 at season's end, leaving McLaren boss Ron Dennis casting around for a new engine partner. Senna is not convinced about the team's future. Meanwhile, Prost sits out the year after comparing his Ferrari to a “horrible truck” and getting fired by the Scuderia as a result.</li>
    <li><strong>1993: McLaren-Ford (2nd, 5 wins)</strong> - Despite a brief offseason test with Team Penske in an Indy car at Phoenix's Firebird International Raceway, Senna elects to return to F1. Meanwhile, Prost rejoins, signing with Williams to chase his fourth title. McLaren secures a Cosworth V8 supply, but Senna is skeptical as Benetton, a Ford works team, has priority--one reason he tried out Penske's Indy car. His '93 McLaren contract is on a race-by-race basis initially as he clashes egos with Dennis.<br>
Williams still has the edge, but McLaren's package is good enough to allow Senna to shine when circumstances allow. His charge from fifth place into the lead on the first lap in a wet European Grand Prix at Donington Park is considered one of F1's most impressive wet-weather performances, and he secures five memorable wins on the year. Having eyed Williams with envy, he finally secures a contract for '94 as Prost retires.</li>
    <li><strong>1994: Williams-Renault (0 points, 0 wins)</strong> - Senna finds the Williams FW16 more difficult to come to grips with than he expected, and he struggles in testing. Nevertheless, he takes the pole in the opening two races, in Brazil and Japan, only to retire after incidents in both, while Michael Schumacher's Benetton-Ford wins both. Senna is convinced the Benetton is illegal and still running then-outlawed traction control, but Williams never files a protest.<br>
Senna puts in another huge effort to take his third-straight pole, at Imola, where emotions run high after Rubens Barrichello is injured on Friday and Roland Ratzenberger is killed in qualifying. Senna leads the race on lap seven when he spears suddenly off the road, with fatal consequences, at Tamburello corner.<br>
Though an Italian court ruled his crash was due to a failed steering column after Williams modified it at the driver's request (Senna did not like the steering wheel's position relative to his seating position), F1 engineers then and now have never identified conclusively why he lost control. After 20 years, it appears we will never know the answer for certain.</li>
